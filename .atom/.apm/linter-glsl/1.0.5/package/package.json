Install [glslangValidator](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/tools/Reference-Compiler/)\n2. Install [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter/), [language-glsl](https://atom.io/packages/language-glsl/) and [linter-glsl](https://atom.io/packages/linter-glsl/), either through 'Install Packages And Themes' or with apm:\n\n   ```sh\n   $ apm install linter language-glsl linter-glsl\n   ```\n3. Configure the path to glslangValidator in preferences.\n4. Lint!\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n * [linter-clang](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-clang/) was used as a reference for interacting with the atom-linter package, styling, and how to write specs for Atom.\n * [linter-haml](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-haml/) was used as a reference for how to create temporary directories and files so that linting can be performed on the fly.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/andystanton/linter-glsl/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/andystanton/linter-glsl#readme","_id":"linter-glsl@1.0.5","_shasum":"bee8d518af3c3e8ac060013b3dd9792cbd04af01","_resolved":"file:../d-1151111-36484-1b04cnj/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151111-36484-1b04cnj/package.tgz"}
