# linter-glsl

linter-glsl is a package for the Atom editor that lints GLSL shaders on the fly.

It uses the Khronos GLSL Validator which is part of the [GL Shading Language reference compiler](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/tools/Reference-Compiler/) as well as the [language-glsl](https://atom.io/packages/language-glsl/) and [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter/) Atom packages.

It also works nicely alongside [autocomplete-glsl](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-glsl).

## Acknowledgements

 * [linter-clang](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-clang/) was used as a reference for interacting with the atom-linter package, styling, and how to write specs for Atom.
 * [linter-haml](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-haml/) was used as a reference for how to create temporary directories and files so that linting can be performed on the fly.
